    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
            <li>2 large eggs </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick pan over medium heat. Once butter is melted, crack eggs into the pan. Tilt pan to evenly distribute eggs. Cook until whites are no longer translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip eggs by pushing the pan away from you and slightly tossing eggs up and over. Move pan upwards to catch eggs.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Cook on second side until desired doneness, 30 to 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
